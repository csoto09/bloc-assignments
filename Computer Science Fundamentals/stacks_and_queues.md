1. What's the main difference between a stack and a queue?
	* The order in which the data is processed: a stack uses LIFO (last one added is the first one to be processed), while queues use FIFO (first one added is the first one to be processed - like standing in line to check out at the grocery store).
2. What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
	* 
3. Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?

## Programming Questions

1. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string `"Bloc!"` should be converted to `"!colB"`.

1. Implement the `pop` method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the , it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.

3. Implement the `enqueue` and `dequeue` methods in the checkpoint inside your own `Queue` class.
