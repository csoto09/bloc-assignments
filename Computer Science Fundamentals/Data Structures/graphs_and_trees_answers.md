# Graphs and Trees

1. What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?
   * Binary tree is a tree-like data structure unique to others in that each node can only point to up to two child nodes.
2. What is a heuristic?
   * a "best guess" approach to solving a problem, as opposed to having to calculate all possible approaches, potentially at the expense of accuracy
3. What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?
   * some theoretical applications of heuristics include the Null-move heuristic, N-queens problem and the traveling salesman problem.
   * real life applications include maps (as discussed in checkpoint), search engines and antivirus programs.
4. What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?
	* DFS travels *down* a single branch while looking for a specific node. If not found, it switches to an adjacent branch and travels up to continue the search.
	* BFS travels through a single row while searching. If
