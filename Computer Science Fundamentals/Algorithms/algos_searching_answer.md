# Algorithms: Searching

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
   * Looking through a phonebook or a rolodex in the listed order.
1. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
   * Looking for the right rack to find a library book.
1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value *G* using linear search?
   * 7 iterations.
1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value *G* using binary search?
   * 4 iterations.
1. Given an *unsorted* collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
   * linear search - binary search does not work with unsorted collections.
1. Given a *sorted* collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning
   * binary search - binary search takes significantly less time to run with large values than linear.

## Programming Assignment

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
1. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
