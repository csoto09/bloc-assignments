# Recursion

1. Define and compare recursion and iteration.
   * recursive function: function that calls itself again to repeat the code
   * iterative function: a function that loops to repeat some part of its code.
   * recursive functions will likely be more resource intensive and use up more stack space than iterative functions. Iterative functions might be more difficult to implement.
1. Name five algorithms that are commonly implemented by recursion
1. When should you use recursion and when should you avoid recursion? Give examples
1. Compare the recursive and iterative solutions to the three algoritms from the checkpoint (`factorial`, `maximum`, `fibonacci`). What is similar, and what is different?
1. Given a multi-dimensional collection (such as an array) where the number of dimensions is unknown, write a recursive algorithm to count the number of items in the entire collection.
1. A palindrome is a word or phrase whose spelling is the same in either direction (e.g., racecar). Write a recursive algorithm to determine if a given word or phrase is a palindrome.
1. Google Easter Egg: Google the term "recursion". Google will prompt you with "Did you mean: **recursion**". Explain why this behavior exhibits properties of recursion.
