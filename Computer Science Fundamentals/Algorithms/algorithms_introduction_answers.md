# Algorithms

1. Using proper pseudocode, describe the following primitive algorithms:
    * Making coffee;
    * Washing dishes;
    * A choice of your own.
1. As with the knot algoritm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g. Google's search algoritm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?
1. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
