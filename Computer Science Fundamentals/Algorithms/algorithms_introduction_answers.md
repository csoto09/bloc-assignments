# Algorithms

1. Using proper pseudocode, describe the following primitive algorithms:
    * Making coffee -
      1. Weigh coffee beans to required amount
      1. Grind coffee beans
      1. Place coffee filter in coffee maker
      1. Add coffee grounds to filter
      1. Add water to coffee maker reservoir and close lid
      1. Power on coffee maker
      1. Wait for coffee maker to finish brewing coffee
      1. Pour coffee into cup
      1. Drink Coffee
    * Washing dishes
      1. Turn on faucet
      1. Adjust knobs until water temperature is lukewarm
      1. Rinse sponge or other cleaning utensil to ensure it is clean and damp
      1. Apply soap to cleaning utensil
      1. Using cleaning tool, apply soap to all surfaces of dirty food vessels
      1. Rinse food vessels under running water
      1. If item is still dirty, repeat steps 5 and 6
      1. Put item on drying rack
      1. Repeat steps 5-8 for remaining dirty dishes
    * A choice of your own - filling up your car with gas
      1. Drive to a nearby gas station.
      1. Pull up to unoccupied gas pump.
      1. Turn off car
      1. Exit the car
      1. Open fuel hatch
      1. Carefully remove pressurized gas cap, exposing the fuel filler neck
      1. Insert credit card into opening on gas pump and follow on screen prompts
      1. Select fuel grade
      1. Grab fuel nozzle
      1. Insert fuel nozzle into filler neck.
      1. Pull trigger on gas nozzle
      1. Hold gas nozzle trigger until safety mechanism shuts down flow of gasoline. This indicates your tank is full.
      1. Place gas nozzle into receptable on gas pump.
      1. Optionally, get receipt from pump.
      1. Replace gas cap, turning until you hear a click.
      1. Close fuel hatch.
      1. Enter car
      1. Turn on car.
      1. Drive away from gas station.
1. As with the knot algoritm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g. Google's search algoritm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?
   1. P. Duff and Sons, Cake Mix: In 1930, due to a surplus of molasses, owner invents a method to dehydrate molasses and add it to a flour mix, simplifying and reducing the steps involved and allowing consumers to make a cake by just adding water and eggs to the mix.
   1. Glucose Meters, Bayer and Roche, 1980s: home glucose monitoring was shown to improve control of type 1 diabetes in the late 70s, with the first meters marketed for home use by 1981. The introduction of these meters to the market allowed patients to monitor their levels with sufficient accuracy and readiness to control their symptoms without needing to rely on infrequent lab tests.
   1. Instant Coffee, Nestle, late 1930s: In 1930, The Brazillian coffee institute asks the chairman of Nestle to create a soluble coffee product that will help with dealing with coffee surpluses and stagnating sales. By 1938, Nescafe is sold and becomes popular very quickly, particularly with soldiers fighting in WWII.
1. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
   * assuming an algorithm is 100% effective at solving a problem, the efficiency of an algorithm would be determined as a measure of how much time or resources are required to reach a solution. Also worth noting that concluding whether an algorithm is or is not effective is dependent on the complexity of the problem being solved and an algorithm's performance compared to other prior or future alternativecs.
