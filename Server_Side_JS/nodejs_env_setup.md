# Node.js Environment Setup

1. What is npm and what does it do?
   * Node.js Package Manager
   * npm allows us to add packages to our application. node also handles dependencies when installing packages. which is great.
1. What kind of information does package.json hold?
   * includes metadata about our package, including name, version, descriptions, licensing, source code repo, etc.
   * also lists dependencies, both for a development environment and for production
1. Google another Node package. Using the demo directory run npm install <theNameOfThePackage> --save. Check the contents of your package.json file to make sure that the dependencies list the name of the Node package.
