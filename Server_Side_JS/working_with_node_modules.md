## Online Research Questions

1. Are there other ways to export a module?
   * In doing research I found two ways: there's `module.exports`, previously discussed in this checkpoint, and there's `exports`. Even this isn't *really* a different way to export a module as `exports` itself is just a reference to `module.exports`. In conclustion - **no, not really**.
1. What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we created in this checkpoint?
    * ES6 Modules are the standarized implementation of modules available from ES6 onwards. They load asyncrhonously and are shared with `export` and `import` keywords.
    * The modules we've been creating thus far are ones based on CommonJS, a third-party module loading syntax now used as the default implementation in Node. CommonJS modules load synchronously and additionally differ from ES6 with their use of `module.exports` and `require`.
