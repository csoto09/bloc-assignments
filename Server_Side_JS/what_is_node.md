# Node Intro

1. In your own words highlight the differences in functionality and purposes Client-Side and Server-Side code serves in a full-stack web application.
   * client-side: handles user interactions in browser, makes http requests and interfaces/manipulates the DOM. runs on browser.
   * server-side: receives and responds to http requests. does not manipulate the DOM. runs on server.
1. What explains Node's rise in popularity and use? What does "Isomorphic JavaScript programming" mean? Provide some real-world examples not listed in this checkpoint of companies using Node.js.
   * Why is node popular: one language for client and server; very fast and efficient; isomorphic js can simplify maintenance and debugging
   * Isomorphic JS programming: writing application code and logic that can run on both client and server using the JS.
   * Companies using node: Walmart, Atlassian, Medium, Groupon, Twitter, Reddit, Coursera, Wikipedia, Medium, eBay
1. Draw a diagram of a full-stack web application and its key components.
